/**
 * NTSC address 0x7F006890.
 * 
 * Ryan spent a few minutes looking at this and left some notes about what this function does:
 *
 * var_s6 is an "error" variable. If set anywhere, the function goes into an infinite loop at the end.
 * The first outer loop appears to be verifying that the waypoints don't list themselves as their own neighbour.
 * The second outer loop appears to do the same but for waygroups. It also calls sub_GAME_7F08F438, which is a more simple version of PD's waypointFindSegmentIntoGroup, so it's likely verifying that there is a waypoint path between this group and each neighbour.
 * The third outer loop is iterating waygroups, then iterating each group's waypoints, and assigning each waypoint's groupNum if it's less than 0. If a value is stored and it's wrong, the error variable is set.
 * The fourth outer loop is checking that all waypoints have a groupNum assigned.
 * The fifth outer loop I'm not sure about without actually decompiling it and naming stuff. It appears to be using the waypoint->dist property temporary so it can validate something. If it doesn't like it then the error variable is set.
 * The final outer loop is the infinite loop which occurs if the error variable is true.
